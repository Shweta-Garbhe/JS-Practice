# Check the strings are anagram of each other or not

Write a function called `isAnagram()` that takes 2 strings as parameters and returns the boolean true / false if both strings are anagram to each other.

## Example:

- Input:

```
const str1 = "abc";
const str2 = "cab";
```

- Output:

```
True
```

## CODE:

```
function isAnagram(str1, str2){
    // If string lenth are not matching returning false
    if(str1.length !== str2.length){
        return false;
    }

    let string1 = str1.split("").sort().join("");
    let string2 = str2.split("").sort().join("");

    return (string1 == string2) ? true : false;
}

console.log(isAnagram(str1, str2));

```

## Explaination:

- We are writing a function `isAnagram` which is accepting 2 strings.
- Function is checking the length of two strings first, if the length is not same, then is returning false. No need to check further logic.
- If both strings are having same length then we are splitting both strings to convert them into array, then applying sort to sort the elements in alphabetical order and then performing join again to convert array into string back with sorted aplhabetical order of strings.
- Now we are checking, if these both strings contain same alphabets (order does not matter because we have already sorted them in alphabetical order)
- If they are equal, the strings are Anagram to one another. If they are not equal, strings are not Anagram to one another.
