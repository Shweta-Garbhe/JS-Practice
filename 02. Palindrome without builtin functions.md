# Palindrome Without Using Any Built In Fucntions.

Write a code which will accept a strings and check passed string is palindrome or not.

## EXAMPLE:

- Input:

```
> const str = "A man, a plan, a canal. Panama";
```

- Output:

```
 Palindrome / Not Palindrome
```

## CODE:

```
function palindrome(str) {
    // Removing non alphanumeric characters with the help of Regex.
    let strNonChars = /[\W_]/g;

    // Replacing non alphanumeric characters with '' and lowering the case of all characters in string.
    let strLowChars = str.toLowerCase().replace(strNonChars, '');

    // computing the length of string
    const strLen = strLowChars.length;

    // Iterating through loop till the middle of string
    for (let i = 0; i < strLen/2; i++ ){
        // checking every character in string from the beginning matches with the characters from the end.
        if(strLowChars[i] !== strLowChars[strLen-1-i]){
            return "Not Palindrome";
        }
    }
    return "Palindrome";
}
let result = palindrome("A man, a plan, a canal. Panama");
console.log(result);
```

## EXPLAINATION:

- We have passed a random strings
- We have removed all special characters from string with the help of regex i.e. [\W_] which is equal to [^A-za-z0-9].
- Then we have coverted the string to smallcase letters and replaced the special characters with blanks "".
- Then we have started the loop from first letter of string till middle length of string.
- In loop, we are checking every character of string from staring matcing with the character from ending.
- Here we are checking all characters till the middle of the string, if it matches with all the charcaters from start to end then the string is palindome and if not, it is not palindrome.
